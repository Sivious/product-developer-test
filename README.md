# Whitbread Product Developer Test

This test is designed to provide a real-world scenario for you to autonomously complete to the best of your ability.

You are to complete as much as you see fit to show us what you are capable of.

**You are expected to spend around 2 - 4 hours on this test.**

## The Scenario

We have a website / apps, where we would like to include a [Foursquare integration](https://developer.foursquare.com/) in the future. As part of this task you have been chosen to create a demo showing how we can integrate the API to show something useful.

You are tasked with creating a page or application which allows you to search for a place by name and return the recommended or popular venues near that location.

You are then free to display the results as you see fit.

## Rules

*   **You are able to use any language, platform, framework or libraries that you think are useful.** For web developers, we think that this is easiest to complete using HTML/JS/CSS. For app developers we expect it to be completed in a native language for your platform (Java, Swift etc).
*   Feel free to use Google, Stack Overflow and any other websites or tutorials for inspiration but ensure it is your own solution that you submit.
*   Feel free to sign up as a Foursquare developer and create an app in order to use their services. Feel free to use the Foursquare public token available from trying out the API endpoints on the foursquare developer website (e.g. https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/users/search -> ’Try it out’)
*   **We must be able to run your code.**
*   **Please submit your code by creating a repository on GitHub and providing us with the link to the repo.**
*   **You must check in your code at least once every 30mins.**
*   When you submit your code **you must send a summary (or have it as your readme.md) explaining the approach you have taken.**

## Bonus Credit

*   Quality Code
*   MVC Approach
*   Tests
*   Good Presentation
*   CSS Frameworks
*   Using a Task Runner / Build Manager (automating your workflow)
*   Your code is easily runnable
